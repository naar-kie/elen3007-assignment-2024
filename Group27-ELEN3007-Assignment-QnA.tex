\section*{Introduction and Background}
The assignment consideres that the position of $\beta$ is known, and after recording \emph{N} flashes at positions $x_k$, and inferes or answers the question: \emph{where is the robot}?\\
The azimuth angles at which the flashes are emmited, at random intervals, are quantified by $\theta_k$ which is uniformly distributed distributed. Since $\theta_k$ is uniformly distributed, we expect more recordings of $x_k$ near or around $\alpha$ which displays the vertical position underwhich the robot is expected to be. The mean value of $x_k$ is distance away from the assumed value of $\alpha$.

\subsection*{Assignment Criterion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Geometry setup of the problem
		\begin{figure}[h]
        		\centering
        		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{elen3007assignfig.png} 
        		\caption{Geometry setup of the problem}
        \end{figure}
	\item $\theta_k$ assumed to be uniform, azimuth angles lying between $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$, it has the PDF:
		\begin{equation}
			p(\theta_k | \alpha, \beta, B) = f_{\Theta | \Omega, \beta, B}( \theta |\alpha) = \frac{1}{\pi}
		\end{equation}
	\item In order to relate the readings of $x_k$ to $\theta_k$, using elementary trigonometry, the derived expression is
		\begin{equation}
			\beta tan \theta_k = x_k - \alpha
		\end{equation}
	\item $x_k$ is independent and identically distributed from normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

\section{? Understanding the Assignment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item since we can't observe $\theta$, we transform to $x_k$. so that means we transform and drop the random variable $\Theta = \theta_k \Rightarrow X = x_k$  and it's PDF(\emph{prior}?) $p(\theta_k | \alpha, \beta, B)$ (given) to $p(x_k | \alpha, \beta, B)$ (proved)
	\item is $\alpha$ supposed to be assumed? if, then $\alpha$ is a constant and we want to find how far off we are from it as given by the measurements (observed data points)
	\item So, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are supposed to have a joint distribution right? and so after we observe $\beta = b$, we condistion $\alpha$ that is $p_{\alpha = a | \beta = b}$. But we are also given data whhich is $\{x_k\}^N _{k = 1}$ to infere the robot's position expressed by the posterior PDF $p_{\alpha | \{x_k\}^N _{k = 1}}(\alpha = a)$
	\item $\alpha$ and $\beta$, are they independent? but $\theta$ won't!
\end{itemize}

\section{? Questions}
	\begin{enumerate}

		\item is this the marginal PDF? $p(\theta_k | \alpha, \beta, B) = \frac{1}{\pi}$
		\item is this the conditional distribution? $p(x_k | \alpha, \beta, B) = \frac{\beta}{\pi (\beta^2 + (x_k - \alpha)^2)}$
		\item in order to plot $p(\alpha | x_k, \beta, B)$, should we assume our own values for the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$?
		\item is this notation correct? $ p(x_k | \alpha, \beta, B) = f_{X | \Omega, \beta, B}(x_k | \alpha, \beta = b)$, where $b = constant$
		\item if then is posterior notation? $p(\alpha | x_k, \beta, B) = f_{\Omega | X, \beta, B}(\alpha) = \frac{\beta}{\pi (\beta^2 + (x_k - \alpha)^2)} \times \aleph$, where $\aleph$ is a \emph{proportional constant} of bayes transformation to posterior PDF
		\item and is? $p(\alpha | \{x_k\}^N _{k = 1}, \beta, B) = f_{\Omega | X, \beta, B}(\alpha | x_1,...,x_n, \beta = b ) = \prod^N _{k = 1} \frac{\beta}{\pi (\beta^2 + (x_k - \alpha)^2)} \times \aleph $
		\item is the $x$-position a matter of how far from the normal(that is $\alpha = 0 = x_0 = 0$ to $x_k = \mu_x$? is this the meaningful conclusion?
		\item because accordring to question 7, it says estimate $x$-position using 30 measurements. what are the other extra data points for? demo?  
		\item is this professional style report clear? and what is meant by effective data representation(graphs of distro. with different no. of N)? \emph{because} is (sub-\&)heading numbering necessary?		
		\item what does the demonstration require? effect of \emph{different number}(N) of observed data points?
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
\section{? other Questions}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item do we need to apply maximum likelyhood solutions for the mean of data?
		\item if (or not) then the goal is to estimate the posterior mean? which can be given by a compromise between the prior mean $\mu_0$ and the maximum likelihood solution $\mu_{ML}$?
		\item are integrals or derivatives or both involved in finding the post-PDF? (marginal PDF)
		\item do we use Maximum-A-Posterior (MAP) to estimate the range or point estimate of $\alpha$?
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Consultation Answerers}


\subsection*{Understanding the Assignment ?}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Yes with the following Equations and Notations: 
 	\begin{eqnarray}
		p(\theta_k | \alpha, \beta, B) = f_{\Theta | \Omega, \beta, B}(\theta)\\
		p(x_k |\alpha, \beta, B) = f_{X | \Lambda, \mathfrak{B}, B}(\, \cdot \, | \alpha, \beta)\\
		\Lambda (\cdot) = \alpha;\: \mathfrak{B}(\cdot) = \beta ; \: X(\cdot) = x_k; \: \Theta ( \cdot) = \theta_k 
	\end{eqnarray}	
	\item no, see answer below
	\item yes, sounds solid
	\item yes they have to be.. what do you think otherwise?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions ?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item yes, it is a prior (marginal) conditional PDF
	\item yes, derivived from the above conditional PDF
	\item yes, you can assume your values and compare as per question
	\item yes, the notation is correct but $f_{X | \Omega, \beta, B}( \, \cdot \, | \alpha, \beta = b)$, where $b = constant$
	\item yes, think some more about the proportionality constant
	\item yes
	\item no, the $\alpha \neq 0$.. phela this assignment point is to find or estimate the value of $\alpha$. but somewhat yes, you can I guess use $x_k \approx \mu_x$
	\item use 30 measurements, but you can use random intervals of $x_{k=n}$ and see how this changes
	\item yes but don't use the report style, use the homework style as per announcement. professional in this instance means typed
	\item for demonstration, just the Matlab code in the appendix. BUT with meaningful comments. Still use the plots to estimate $\alpha = x$-position
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{other Questions ?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item yes, sounds like a good idea if you know whatever it means
	\item sounds solid
	\item the intergral is the proportionality constant, do you really need it? no? normalisation?
	\item not really maybe?
	
\end{enumerate}
